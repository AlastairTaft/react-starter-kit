# Simple React Starter Kit
This is a barebones repository for writing static client side react applications. 
Should be enough to get started without adding to much.

Start with `yarn install` to fetch dependencies.

 - `npm start` Run the code in development mode
 - ~~`npm run build` Compile the assets, ready to run in production. Generates the static code in the docs folder.~~


## Technology

 - Webpack 2 (for client bundle)
 - Babel (ES6 to ES5)
 - react-router v4 (single page app navigation)
 - redux (managing application state)
 - jss for css handling
 - hot reloading for better development

Doesn't use any special build tools, just npm and node scripts. Uses 
webpack for generating the client bundle. Uses redux for managing application state.
